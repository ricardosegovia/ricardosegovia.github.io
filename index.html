My research has aimed to identify structural features of biodiversity to understand evolutionary and biogeographic processes. I'm currently a postdoc at the <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/kdexter/HOME.html">PLEEBS group</a> in Edinburgh, and an associate researcher in the <a href="http://www.ieb-chile.cl/en/">Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity (Chile)</a>.

In addition, I'm interested in the scientific study of the relationship between societies and environments in global and local scales.  As a member of the Chilean community of scientists, I'm also interested in <a href="http://old.nodoxxi.cl/wp-content/uploads/CC18_Cultura.pdf">the modernization of the science policy</a> of my country.
