My research has aimed to address questions around the evolutionary structure of biodiversity in order to make a contribution to the knowledge of the evolution of life on Earth. My focus during the last years has been the study of the historical relationship between tropical and extratropical biotas. I'm currently a postdoc at the <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/kdexter/HOME.html">PLEEBS group</a> in Edinburgh, and an associate researcher in the <a href="http://www.ieb-chile.cl/en/">Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity (Chile)</a>.

<p id=“p2” align="justify">
In addition, I'm interested in the scientific study of the relationship between societies and environments in global and local scales.  As a member of the Chilean community of scientists, I'm also interested in <a href="http://www.nodoxxi.cl/wp-content/uploads/CC18_Cultura.pdf">the modernization of the science policy</a> of my country.

    <strong>Global genus-level phylogeny for trees </strong> <br />
    In collaboration with Kyle Dexter from The University of Edinburgh, we are developing a new, dated phylogeny with matK and rbcL markers. At the moment, we have added 3950 genera.
