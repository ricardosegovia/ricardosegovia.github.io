  My research has aimed to address questions around the evolutionary structure of biodiversity in order to make a contibution to the knowledge of the evolution of the life in our planet. My focus during the lasts years has been the study of the historical relationship between tropical and extratropical biotas. In addition, I'm interested in the scietific study of the relationship between societies and evironments in global and local scales. I'm currently postdoc at the <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/kdexter/HOME.html">PLEEBS group</a> and associate researcher in the <a href="http://www.ieb-chile.cl/en/">Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity (Chile)</a>. As member of the chilean community of scientists, I'm also interested in <a href="http://www.nodoxxi.cl/wp-content/uploads/CC18_Cultura.pdf">the modernization of the scientific politcy of my country</a>; and as a human, being I'm deeply concerned about the environemntal and climatic crises that affect the world.

  <li>
    <strong>Global genus-level phylogeny for trees </strong> <br />
    In collaboration with Kyle Dexter from The University of Edinburgh, we are developing a new dated phylogeny for all genera of trees around the world. At the moment, we have a phylogeny for matK and rbcL markers with 4121 tips.

    <strong>Southern South American forests plots</strong> <br />
    In collaboration with Rodrigo Chaura, we are building a network of forests plots from Chile. At the moment we have more than 100 plots of half hectare across central and southern Chile.
