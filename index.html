My research has aimed to address questions around the evolutionary structure of biodiversity in order to make a contribution to the knowledge of the evolution of life on our planet. My focus during the last years has been the study of the historical relationship between tropical and extratropical biotas. I'm currently a postdoc at the <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/kdexter/HOME.html">PLEEBS group</a> in Edinburgh, and an associate researcher in the <a href="http://www.ieb-chile.cl/en/">Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity (Chile)</a>.

In addition, I'm interested in the scientific study of the relationship between societies and the environments in global and local scales.  As a member of the Chilean community of scientists, I'm also interested in <a href="http://www.nodoxxi.cl/wp-content/uploads/CC18_Cultura.pdf">the modernization of the scientific policy</a> of my country; and as a human being, I'm deeply concerned about the environmental and climatic crises that affect the world.

  <li>
    <strong>Global genus-level phylogeny for trees </strong> <br />
    In collaboration with Kyle Dexter from The University of Edinburgh, we are developing a new dated phylogeny (matK and rbcL markers) for all genera of trees around the world. At the moment, we have a phylogeny for 3950 genera.

    <li>
    <strong>Southern South American forest plots</strong> <br />
    In collaboration with Rodrigo Chaura, we are building a network of forest plots from Chile. At the moment we have more than 100 plots of 0.05 ha across central and southern Chile.
